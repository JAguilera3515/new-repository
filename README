  The project we have chosen is the installation and deployment option. Where we will use Vault which is an image that is 
  used to store and secure private data such as passwords. This information will be stored on a SQL database that will be accesible to
  users with their corresponding username and password through the web. Vault is used to secure the database. We will be using Docker
  for this.
